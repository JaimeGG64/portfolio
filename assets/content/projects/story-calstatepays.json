This was the first project I got to work as part time Front-End developer at META+LAB. I used my knowledge of graphic design and learn how the application can leverage the Vue framework.\n\n## Early Stages\n\n### Paper Wireframes\n\n### Adobe XD\n\n## Final Product\n\n## Takeaways\nI had the chance to work with a wonder teammate to help build CalStatePays. As we were working on the project, I quickly realized about the importance of communication and code quality. Every member of the must have a clear idea of their responsible. It also does not hurt to assistant from fellow developers.  \n\n## Publicity\n* [Cal Poly Pomona PolyCentric](http://polycentric.cpp.edu/2019/03/website-shows-potential-salary-earnings-of-cpp-graduates/)\n* [CSUN Today](https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/community/when-economy-slows-university-degrees-deliver-great-value-csun-experts/)",
